**__[Press Release__]** HOUSTON, Texas, February 1, 2021 – As the Vathes LLC team focuses on key priorities to be delivered in the year ahead, the company’s Member Board is pleased to announce Dimitri Yatsenko’s appointment as CEO effective today.

Dr. Yatsenko co-founded the company in 2016, and has served as its President and, most recently, as VP of Research and Development. While taking on the broader role, he will continue to serve as the Principal Investigator on the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) $3.8 million five-year research and development project, "DataJoint Pipelines for Neurophysiology."

“I am honored to lead such a tremendous team with the work we have ahead of us. So much is happening across neuroscience with the exabytes of data being generated by leading labs across the U.S. and globally”, said Dr. Yatsenko on his appointment. “It is especially exciting that our company is positioned to contribute solutions that will help diverse research teams make sense of these oceans of data.”

Among the company’s key priorities is the development of a line of scientific database systems and cloud-based services designed to support collaborative neurophysiology experiments being pursued in the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies [(BRAIN)](https://braininitiative.nih.gov/) Initiative, a large-scale national effort to accelerate neuroscience research. The technology being developed supplements advanced instrumentation with data analysis techniques, including machine learning, to extract complex patterns in neurocircuit activity, as well as enhance collaboration and data sharing in partnership with several research institutions.

Dr. Edgar Y. Walker, a co-founder of Vathes LLC, who served as CEO since May 2020 and VP of Engineering prior to that, will continue serving on the Member Board. He will continue pursuing advanced research at the intersection of neuroscience and machine learning at the University of Tübingen, Germany.
