Vathes LLC began work under a service agreement to build and support the data pipeline for the multi-lab collaborative project nicknamed the “Mesoscale Activity Project” or MAP.  This three-year project aims to analyze brain-wide neural activity during behavior and publish the datasets for the general scientific community.
